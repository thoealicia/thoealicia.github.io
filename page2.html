                	<p>My name is Alicia B Thoe. The “B” stands for Bethany, except I don’t like Bethany. I just like B and that’s all. Actually I don’t like the B either. I don’t even like Alicia (sorry mom and dad), so I go by Ali. As of today, January 7 2018, I am a seventeen year old who is really just trying to get through high school and begin the rest of my life, except that doesn’t include college. At least not this year. No, I am not rebelling against my parents or throwing my life away. In fact, my father was actually the one who proposed the idea to me. We got into a huge fight and everything about it, but we finally both agreed that it was the best option for me (I hate when he’s right). This means I have an entire year where I have nothing to do and for the first time in my life, I can choose what I am doing with my time. Like any teenager that lives on Earth, obviously I want to BOUNCE (just kidding, love you dad). I plan on doing whatever I can to see the entire world in 365. Will I be able to accomplish it? Realistically, no. A girl can still hope, though.</p>
                	<p>I suppose this is where I tell you about my story (no pun intended) and how reading became such a big part of it. Clearly, it’s a huge part since I am willing to write an entire website about. The first book I remember reading was <i>A Wrinkle In Time</i> when I was five years old with my dad. I have now read that five times. I fell out of love with reading for a couple years due to my class being dual immersion and even I didn’t want to read books in Spanish. Third grade was I met Mrs. Cease and she changed my approach to reading. I moved to Davis in fourth grade and began filling my time reading as I had ultimately no friends. Two years later, I had Ms. Sequeira as my sixth grade teacher and was assigned the impossible 40 book challenge. I read 92 books by the end of the year. Crushed it. Little did I realize that was the beginning of my addiction to novels. I become captivated by the stories that are imprinted within the pages of every book. When I find a series I love, no one can pull me out. I once 1,885 pages in four days because anything is possible if you put your mind to it. Junior year I stayed home for three days after my last AP exam because I was “sick” (PSA: <i>To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before</i> is a really good series!). It’s not always good, but it’s never bad.</p>

                <h3>Why We Started</h3>	
                <p>I am not going to lie, I started this website as a project for my computer science class. With that in mind, that does not mean I haven’t tried to start a blog in the past. No, I am not giving you the name of it nor will you ever find it so HAH. One of the hardest things for me about reading is finishing a series and falling into a depression where I have no idea how to live with these characters. The only thing that saves me (or rather starts the cycle over. It’s not healthy, I know) is when I find yet another series. That causes another problem, though. Have you SEEN how many books there are? While I would LOVE to buy them all, my dad said I would have to use my own money then and I’m broke (GoFundMe page coming next!). What better way to save money than to read a short, only slightly biased review that isn’t actually benefiting whatsoever from you buying the books! Wait, what if I can monetize my reviews… Does that involve more code?</p>
